I am Tripadvisor Scraper, created to help you find hotel and restaurant leads leads and grow your sales.. üöÄ

*Why Scrape Tripadvisor?* 
Here's why Tripadvisor is the perfect *hunting ground* for Hotels and Restaurants:
- TripAdvisor leads are less frequently scraped than those from Google Maps, resulting in lower competition and higher conversion rates.
- TripAdvisor exclusively focuses on hotels and restaurants, ensuring that you receive only the most relevant hotel and restaurant leads.
- TripAdvisor provides direct access to potential clients' phone numbers, emails, and websites, significantly reducing the time it takes to close a deal.

## ü§î FAQs
### ‚ùì How to Scrape Hotels and Restaurants from Tripadvisor?

1. Open the `main.py` file.
2. Update the `locations` list with the locations you are interested in. For example:

```python
locations = [
  "New York",
  "Los Angeles",
  "Chicago",
  "Washington DC",
]

Tripadvisor.search(locations, type=Tripadvisor.HOTEL, max=100)
```

3. Run it.

```bash
python main.py
```

Then find your Tripadvisor leads in the `output` directory.

![Tripadvisor Scraper CSV Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/tripadvisor-scraper/master/images/tripadvisor-scraper-csv-result.png)

Also, to scrape restaurants, use the following example:

```python
locations = [
  "New York",
  "Los Angeles",
  "Chicago",
  "Washington DC",
]

Tripadvisor.search(locations, type=Tripadvisor.RESTAURANT, max=100)
```


### ‚ùì How to scrape all cities in my country?

The following example demonstrates how to scrape 100 hotels from 10 cities in UnitedStates.

```python
locations = Tripadvisor.Cities.UnitedStates()[0:10]
Tripadvisor.search(locations, type=Tripadvisor.HOTEL, max=100) 
```

After running the code, an `united-states-cities.json` file will be generated in the `output` directory with a list of all American cities.

You can prioritize certain cities by editing the cities JSON file in the output folder and moving them to the top of the list.

See the list of all supported countries [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/tripadvisor-scraper/blob/master/countries.md). 

### ‚ùì How to Scrape All The Hotels in My Target Location?

To search for all hotels in your target location, remove the `max` parameter. This will scrape all the hotels available in the specified locations.

```python
locations = [
  "Detroit",
]

Tripadvisor.search(locations, type=Tripadvisor.HOTEL)
```

### ‚ùì How to Scrape More Tripadvisor Listings Using Your Tripadvisor API?

To scrape additional locations, follow these steps to use our Tripadvisor API with the Free Plan. You can make 50 requests for free, allowing you to scrape 1500 (50 * 30) listings at no cost:
1. Sign up on RapidAPI by visiting [this link](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up).

![Sign Up on RapidAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sign-up.png)

2. Then, subscribe to our Free Plan by visiting [this link](https://rapidapi.com/Chetan11dev/api/tripadvisor-scraper/pricing).

![Subscribe to Free Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/tripadvisor-scraper/master/images/tripadvisor-free-subscription.png)

3. Now, copy the API key.

![Copy the API Key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/tripadvisor-scraper/master/images/tripadvisor-api-key.png) 

4. Use it in the scraper as follows:
```python
Tripadvisor.search("Atlanta", type=Tripadvisor.HOTEL, max=100, key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

5. Run the script, and you'll find hotels in Amritsar in the `output` folder.
```bash
python main.py
```   

The first 50 requests are free. After that, you can upgrade to the Pro Plan, which will get you 30,000 listings (1000 requests * 30) for just $9.


### ‚ùì Tripadvisor also offers a Content API. How are you better than them?

- Most importantly, because Tripadvisor's Content API is very expensive. For example, if you want to scrape 30 hotels, you need to request for each location separately. Each request costs $0.01, and querying just 30 locations will cost you $0.30. While in our API, you just need to make 1 request and you will get 30 hotels for $0.009 only, which is 33x cheaper compared to Tripadvisor's Content API.

- Unlike TripAdvisor, which requires your credit card information even before you try their API, we're confident in the value of our service. Therefore, we offer a no-strings-attached free tier without the prerequisite of credit card details, allowing you to experience our API and recognize its benefits before buying it.

- We are much simpler to use; just enter a city and you get 30 listings along with their email, phone, and website. While in Tripadvisor, you need to first search for a location, get their location IDs, and then for each location ask for data, leading to hard-to-write code, slower application, and more chances of request errors and bugs.

- Additionally, compared to other APIs, we scrape multiple data points including email, phone number, website, ranking, reviews, ratings, featured images, and detailed address, etc., ensuring you have all the data you need.

- Thanks to parallelization and caching, our APIs run super fast, like F-35 ‚ö°.
