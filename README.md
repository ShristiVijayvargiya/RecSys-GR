## ü§î FAQs
### ‚ùì How to Scrape Hotels and Restaurants from Tripadvisor?

1. Open the `main.py` file.
2. Update the `locations` list with the locations you are interested in. For example:

```python
locations = [
  "New York",
  "Los Angeles",
  "Chicago",
  "Washington DC",
]

Tripadvisor.search(locations, type=Tripadvisor.HOTEL, max=100)
```

3. Run it.

```bash
python main.py
```

Then find your Tripadvisor data in the `output` directory.

Also, to scrape restaurants, use the following example:

```python
locations = [
  "New York",
  "Los Angeles",
  "Chicago",
  "Washington DC",
]

Tripadvisor.search(locations, type=Tripadvisor.RESTAURANT, max=100)
```


### ‚ùì How to scrape all cities in my country?

The following example demonstrates how to scrape 100 hotels from 10 cities in UnitedStates.

```python
locations = Tripadvisor.Cities.UnitedStates()[0:10]
Tripadvisor.search(locations, type=Tripadvisor.HOTEL, max=100) 
```

After running the code, an `united-states-cities.json` file will be generated in the `output` directory with a list of all American cities.

You can prioritize certain cities by editing the cities JSON file in the output folder and moving them to the top of the list.

See the list of all supported countries [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/tripadvisor-scraper/blob/master/countries.md). 

### ‚ùì How to Scrape All The Hotels in My Target Location?

To search for all hotels in your target location, remove the `max` parameter. This will scrape all the hotels available in the specified locations.

```python
locations = [
  "Detroit",
]

Tripadvisor.search(locations, type=Tripadvisor.HOTEL)
```
